### About Us 


Our team has a long tradition in machine learning for relational structured domains. Currently our focus is on learning with (temporal) knowledge graphs, where we also explore quantum computing solutions.  Our interest in cognitive AI was the reason that we are increasingly exploring multimodal data, such as texts, images, and videos.  Foundation models are becoming important for our work.  Our ultimate goal is to understand human level intelligence.
