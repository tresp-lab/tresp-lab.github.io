In 2024, we have papers accepted at ICML, CVPR, NAACL(including one oral), EMNLP, COLM, and WACV. Topics include temporal knowledge graphs, (multimodal) large language models, image generation, AI interpretability, and AI safety, etc. You can find the publications [here](https://tresp-lab.github.io/publications/).
